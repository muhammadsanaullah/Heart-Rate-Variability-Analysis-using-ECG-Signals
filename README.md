# Heart Rate Variability Analysis using ECG Signals
This project focuses on the topic of Heart Rate Variability (HRV) in different Electrocardiogram (ECG) signals.
ECG signals describe the cardiovascular activity inside the heart of a living being. The PQRST complex helps in further understanding
the concept of heart rate variability. R peaks from this complex are sampled consecutively to give RR intervals which are the main 
variables in observing HRV. RR intervals are interpolated and undergone time domain analyzing methods and frequency domain analyzing
methods which define the HRV of that respective ECG signal.

Once RR intervals are analyzed and the HRV for that ECG signal is defined, different ECG signals can be sampled to find 
differences between them in terms of HRVs. Differences in HRV were seen in both short-term and long-term ECG signals. 
The main area of analysis of for HRV in different ECG signals was between different physical activities, different age groups,
different genders and differences in cardiovascular conditions.
